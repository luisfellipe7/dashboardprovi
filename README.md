### provi challenge - javascript developer

Imagine that you were tasked with building a dashboard where users who received loans can see their installments outstanding, total debt amount, total interest, etc ...

Looking at this challenge from the customer's perspective, what features do you think are ideal for a loan management and monitoring dashboard?

With that in mind, imagine that you are a "single dev army" and have the responsibility to develop an MVP from that dashboard and present it to the rest of the team.

### follow the steps below to take the challenge:

1. Create a repository on github.
2. Use the CRA (create-react-app) to generate the initial structure of the project.
3. Feel free to make http calls as you prefer.
4. Feel free to use some UI / UX framework or make your own design.
5. When finished, pull request your challenge and then fork.
6. If you feel the need to "fail" some text on the screen that is not in the API (user name, photo, email, messages, etc.), no problem.
7. If you are unable to fork / pull request, forward the zipped repo to luciano@provi.com.br or padilha@provi.com.br

### What are we going to take into account

1. Good UI / UX principles
2. Good notion of design patterns.
3. Use Redux / Context for state management.
4. Use Hooks.
5. Organization of github (commits, pull requests).

### Comments

1. If you have any questions during the challenge, feel free to contact us. (You can find us on the react-brasil slack @padil, @lucianokrebs or through our emails mentioned above)
2. Do it calmly and with quality and use a reasonable time.

#### Explanation of the data in the loan's ENDPOINT:

ENDPOINT: http://www.mocky.io/v2/5c923b0932000029056bce39

2. monthlyInterest: Monthly interest rate
3. amountPayd: Total amount paid
4. amountTaken: Total amount borrowed
5. installments: All installments of the loan

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
